.SH "NAME"
ranlib \- generate index to archive.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
ranlib [\fB\-vV\fR] \fIarchive\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBranlib\fR generates an index to the contents of an archive and
stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by a
member of an archive that is a relocatable object file.
.PP
You may use \fBnm \-s\fR or \fBnm \-\-print\-armap\fR to list this index.
.PP
An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library and
allows routines in the library to call each other without regard to
their placement in the archive.
.PP
The \s-1GNU\s0 \fBranlib\fR program is another form of \s-1GNU\s0 \fBar\fR; running
\&\fBranlib\fR is completely equivalent to executing \fBar \-s\fR.

Show the version number of \fBranlib\fR.
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
